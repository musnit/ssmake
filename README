This script takes in a .gif file, cuts it into different pieces and then turns each piece into a spritesheet rather than a gif.

Usage:
ssmake filename numpieceshorizontal numpiecesvertical

Example:
ssmake examples/input/test.gif 13 10

Test:
npm test

Note: Code sucks, need to refactor and use promises.
